/*
What is the Big O notation for Function findStudentById . Explain your reason.
Answer:
The Big O notation for the function findStudentById is O(n). This is because it performs a linear search,
checking each student one by one until it finds the matching id or reaches the end of the array.

/* 
What is the Big O notation for Function findProductPrice. Explain your reason.
Answer:
The Big O notation for the function findProductPrice is O(n). This is because it performs a linear search, 
checking each product one by one until it finds the matching name or reaches the end of the array.

*/

/* 
Which function is more efficient and why?
Answer:
Both findStudentById and findProductPrice have O(n) time complexity since they use linear search, 
so they are equally efficient in Big O terms. Actual performance may vary depending on array size or the element's position.
